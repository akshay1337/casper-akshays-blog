The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Casper 1.4 is the last release of Casper's original design, created to be compatible **ONLY with Ghost 1.0** and above. If you are running an earlier version of Ghost, you will need [Casper 1.3.7](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases/tag/1.3.7). For all other versions of Ghost, we recommend switching to the [latest release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) of Casper, with an updated design.

To download, visit the [releases](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) page.
